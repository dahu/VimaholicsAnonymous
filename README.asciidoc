Vimaholics Anonymous
--------------------

__Vim, Give us the grace to accept with serenity
the things that cannot be called, Tools
to call the things which should be called,
And the Mechanics to distinguish the one from the other.__

TIP: If you like Vimaholics Anonymous and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for
https://www.gittip.com/bairuidahu/[tips] or

Vimaholics Anonymous provides anonymous functions for Vim. The Fn() function
declares an anonymous function and the Fx() function executes an anonymous
function. An example can be found at
http://of-vim-and-vigor.blogspot.com/2014/01/anonymous-functions-in-viml.html
and the plugin https://github.com/dahu/UTest relies on Vimaholics Anonymous.

*New:*

* Partial() for creating partially applied functions
* Reduce() for folding a list by some function

There are a fex examples of these new features in the ++test/++ directory.
